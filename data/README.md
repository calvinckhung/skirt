This folder contains the input/output data run through SKIRT pipeline, including KIR allele annotations for HPRC Year-1 47 assemblies, hs37d5, GRCh38, and CHM13v2 (T2T) genomes.

## View KIR with IGV
* If you want to check the generated KIR haplotypes and alleles using IGV, just download the BED & VCF files for the sample.
* Go to our Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8094803 to download the respective FASTA file.
* Load the FASTA, BED, and VCF into IGV.

## View KIR with UCSC Genome Browser
* You can check the generated KIR haplotypes and alleles for T2T, GRCh38(hg38), HS37D5(HG19) using USCS Genome Browser
  * T2T: https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hub_3671779_hs1
  * GRCH38(HG38): https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38
  * HS37D5(HG19): https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19
* Load the BED file using the "add custom tracks" button, and you will see the allele annotations of the entire KIR gene complex.
